Version 0.2.2rc (2020-01-08)

- TODO implement feedback from https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/eleleu/my_first_cli_in_rust_lsvine_list_contents_of/

- enh: skip empty dirs
- enh: refactor `l1` and `l2` to `level1_paths` and `level2_paths`

- feat: improve the final conversion of the Vec<Level1Dir> into a displayable Table by factoring out a TableBuf struct and impl
- feat: improve the first conversion Vec<Path> to Vec<Level1Dir> by by factoring out a `vecpath2vecl1dir` function
